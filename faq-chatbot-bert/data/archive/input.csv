How many times do I need to answer the vaccination status question?,Once.
After Im registered how can I update my information? ,"Once registered, users have the ability to update their information on an 'as-needed' basis by managing their account in the Daily Heath Assessment.  Within Manage Account, users can change their preferred mobile phone number and the associate designation.  All changes are saved once youve received and entered a one-time passcode to validate the changes.<FEEDBACK/>"
What is an associate designation and when would I need to update it?,"There are four associate designations in WorkSafe. The designation you choose should reflect where you are working and who you may be interacting with.

However, if you then go into the field the next day to visit a client then you should designate 'External-Non Patient/Member' for that day.<FEEDBACK/>"

"For associates who are 100% Work@Home before being sent home for COVID-19, what is the requirement for them to go into the PulsePoint?","All associates are valuable members of the Anthem team and will continue to be in our hybrid workforce model regardless of current location or work arrangement. How often associates are expected to go into a PulsePoint depends on their hybrid category.  Associates who were full-time W\@H prior to COVID-19 and are too far from an Anthem PulsePoint (requiring air travel, for example) or those whose PulsePoint closed and there is no other PulsePoint within commutable distance may continue to work primarily virtually or in the field,likely in the H3Q category even if they cant get to the office three times per quarter.  Associates who are within a reasonable commuting distance are expected to visit a PulsePoint according to their assigned hybrid category frequency.<FEEDBACK/>"
"I have some concerns in that if I do (or do not) go into a PulsePoint, this will tell others what my vaccination A: status is. Isn't this an invasion of privacy?","It is important to understand that this attestation is not a violation of HIPAA nor a privacy concern.  An employer asking about vaccination status is not covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and is not a violation of HIPAA or any other privacy regulations. Any inquiries from the company regarding associates vaccine status is treated as confidential information.  As for others seeing associates enter (or not be present in) a PulsePoint, we should respect each others privacy and what may appear to be their vaccination status.  People have many reasons for getting not getting the vaccine.  We will work with all associates to ensure that they remain connected no matter their status or where they work.  With many associates working at home, it may be difficult to discern who is/is not vaccinated on any given day.<FEEDBACK/>"
I ordered my ID badge.  Do I have to go in and pick it up in order to get the badge number?  I know I need the badge number to register for WorkSafe.,"No, you dont need to go to the office to pick up your badge in order to register for Worksafe. Once your badge order is complete, you can look up your badge number in the<a href='https://bam.antheminc.com/' target='_blank'> online badge look up tool</a> or request it via email from <a href=""mailto:BuildingAccessRequests\@anthem.com"">Building Access Request</a>.

"I plan on getting the vaccine, but I wont be considered fully vaccinated on the 8/4 date to enter vaccination status in WorkSafe.  Can I answer the questions again in the future?","Yes, you will be able to update your vaccine status in WorkSafe once you are fully vaccinated."
I understand that I will continue to work at home in the future and I am not near any PulsePoints.  Do I still need to register for WorkSafe?  Do I need to get the vaccine if I never plan to visit a PulsePoint?,"We do need all associates to have a badge, to register for WorkSafe, and answer the vaccination status question so that we can prepare for the future.  That does not mean that you have to get the vaccine, but there may be times when associates will be asked to visit a PulsePoint or attend an event where vaccination is required.  All associates are encouraged to be vaccinated and to visit our PulsePoints when possible.<FEEDBACK/>  "
"I have to work in a PulsePoints and since Im not fully vaccinated yet, my WorkSafe gives me a 'red screen' that means my badge wont admit me to the PulsePoint.  I need to continue to go in until 8/9.  What do I do?","Notify your manager to have your name added to a temporary approval list to give you access through 8/8. As of August 9th, associates will not be allowed in the office unless they are fully vaccinated.  If you become fully vaccinated after 8/9, you can change your vaccination status on WorkSafe and, after passing the daily health screening in WorkSafe (the COVID-19 symptom questions you should answer every day before you go in), then your badge will work again.<FEEDBACK/>  "
"What if I dont have a smartphone, can I access WorkSafe from the web?","To access your WorkSafe account from Pulse Web, go to Pulse and under Tools & Resources click on WorkSafe in the menu.

What will happen in 2022 as far as the fully vaccinated requirement goes to work in a PulsePoint?,We will continue to assess the situation and the health of our communities throughout the year and will make changes accordingly.  Its too soon to determine what we will do in 2022.<FEEDBACK/>
"Between now and the date that the vaccine policy goes into effect, does anything change with visiting  a PulsePoint?","You should follow the same processes:  enter only for business critical reasons, obtain manager approval before entering, unvaccinated individuals must wear a face covering and practice social distancing, not hold in-person meetings in the office unless it is business critical.  These procedures and details on how we will handle the transition can be found <a href='https://pulse.antheminc.com/webcenter/portal/Pulse/system/DefaultDetail?contentID=AEPULSE_278750' target='_blank'> here.</a> here.

Is the Harrisburg VA location or data centers considered to be a 'PulsePoint'?,"Harrisonburg, VA is Anthems primary data center and the only 'data center' that has only that use (i.e. it is a building that is only there for the data center and not a smaller, non-primary data center within an Anthem building that has other Anthem functions/workspace, like St. Louis or Richmond).  To answer the question, Harrisonburg IS NOT one of the 91 PulsePoint locations.

"I dont want to complete the WorkSafe app,do I have to?","Returning to the designated PulsePoints for 2021 is voluntary for those who are fully vaccinated.  As communicated in our memo to all Atlanta area associates, we are asking all Atlanta-based associates to indicate their vaccination status in WorkSafe so that we can plan for the future and get an idea of how many people might visit the office this year. Associates who are required to go to the office in the future or who visit at any time must complete the WorkSafe questionnaire.<FEEDBACK/> 
 "
Is parking paid?,"Weve got you covered whether you take the bus, the train, or drive.  Well cover the cost of the train and the bus, and parking will be free.   If you have an electric car, we have complimentary charging stations.  And carpoolers get front row parking.  Bicycles, scooters, and skateboards are welcome, too.<FEEDBACK/> "
My associate was full time W@H. What hybrid category should she be? ,"Associates who used to be 'Work\@Home' (working at home full time) are now classified as 'H3Q' and are encouraged to visit the office three times per quarter to meet other associates and participate in events as much as possible. This will give the associate a well-rounded company experience.  There are certainly associates who may never be able to come to the office if they live beyond a reasonable commute or may not be able to visit as often as suggested. The hybrid categories have suggested number of days to visit the office,its not a hard and fast rule.<FEEDBACK/>     "
Why dont we ask for proof/verification of vaccination?,Thank you for the question!  Our vaccination verification is achieved through associates attesting whether or not they are fully vaccinated through the required <b>'yes/no'</b> question on WorkSafe. We expect that all associates answer this question honestly and in accordance with our values and ethical principles.<FEEDBACK/>
